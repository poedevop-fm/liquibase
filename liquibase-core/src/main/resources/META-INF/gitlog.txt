7b311fc Added support for constraint name in addNotNullConstraint change. Currently supported for Oracle database only, where NOT NULL column property is represented as dedicated database constraint object. Reason: if constraint name is not specified, Oracle generates random/sequenced name SYS_XXXXXXX. In this case 3rd party database diff tools show lots of changes in identical schemas created on separate database instances, since automatically generated names usually don't match SQL syntax:  ALTER TABLE table MODIFY column CONSTRAINT constraint_name NOT NULL

ea9f803 Most of the way though the large refactoring of the ant tasks. Added two new ant types: DatabaseType and ChangeLogParametersType These can be defined outside of the ant tasks and reused. Migrated over the BaseLiquibaseTask to use the new types and ported over the old attributes to maintain backward compatibility. Added two new abstract classes that extend from BaseLiquibaseTask that will encapsulate the common functionality from change log tasks and diff tasks. I performed the same migration of old attributes to the new types. Still have to finish refactoring the diff tasks and generate change log tasks. A lot of additional documentation and deprecation marking was completed and logging was added to notify users of deprecated attributes to migrate over to the new model.

The behavior seemed to differ between Linux and Windows. I don't really know why yet.

7c7c863 CORE-1207. Improving Liquibase startup time by pre-caching values of costly methods in SqlGeneratorFactory: 50% improvement in startup speed.
bdb56c0 CORE-1219. Removed empty DatabaseException catch blocks around database.rollback() calls in the LockService, which were believed to hide the real cause of the problem described in the incident. Initially, it was thought that no databse.rollback() was being called, thus leaving the Oracle lock hanging. However, the code inspection revealed that database.rollback() must have been called (as it was alreay in the finally block); however, it must have failed for some reason, and this reason was not reported due to empty DatabaseException catch blocks.

c748abd It helps if I actually run tests, because then I find problems like stale references to the old name of the XSD.
ba54a9a Per nvoxland's feedback on https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2, I've renamed the XSD to go with the next minor release (2.1) instead of the next point release (2.0.2).
6f193f7 Include at least one test case for the namespaced-attributes-are-meaningless-to-liquibase feature. This test duplicates simpleChangeLogTest, except that (a) the schema used is the 2.0.2 schema and (b) it contains some meaningless attributes.
7b844ba Allow namespaced attributes on the following elements:  - <databaseChangeLog> - semantically, applying to this whole changelog.  - <include> - semantically, applying to the whole included changelog.  - <includeAll> - as with <include>  - <changeSet> - semantically, applying only to that change set.

e4214b6 JUnits tuning. Add Database#isPeculiarLiquibaseSchema method to define whether a database support own schema name for liquibase tables.
cf435b3 Working on the green JUnit tests @ mssql (really not finished). Adding a opportunity to setup schema name for Liquibase system tables in other then executed changelogs. (new method Database#getLiquibaseSchemaName()) By default the method delegates to the #getDefaultSchemaName() and preserve previous execution for mostly database. Only under MS Sql server tables DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK are created in the [dbo]. This refactoring could breaks existed environment for MS SQL databases and intended to be discussed in the user and/or developer list.
