7b311fc6a Added support for constraint name in addNotNullConstraint change. Currently supported for Oracle database only, where NOT NULL column property is represented as dedicated database constraint object. Reason: if constraint name is not specified, Oracle generates random/sequenced name SYS_XXXXXXX. In this case 3rd party database diff tools show lots of changes in identical schemas created on separate database instances, since automatically generated names usually don't match SQL syntax:  ALTER TABLE table MODIFY column CONSTRAINT constraint_name NOT NULL

ea9f803f9 Most of the way though the large refactoring of the ant tasks. Added two new ant types: DatabaseType and ChangeLogParametersType These can be defined outside of the ant tasks and reused. Migrated over the BaseLiquibaseTask to use the new types and ported over the old attributes to maintain backward compatibility. Added two new abstract classes that extend from BaseLiquibaseTask that will encapsulate the common functionality from change log tasks and diff tasks. I performed the same migration of old attributes to the new types. Still have to finish refactoring the diff tasks and generate change log tasks. A lot of additional documentation and deprecation marking was completed and logging was added to notify users of deprecated attributes to migrate over to the new model.

The behavior seemed to differ between Linux and Windows. I don't really know why yet.

bdb56c01e CORE-1219. Removed empty DatabaseException catch blocks around database.rollback() calls in the LockService, which were believed to hide the real cause of the problem described in the incident. Initially, it was thought that no databse.rollback() was being called, thus leaving the Oracle lock hanging. However, the code inspection revealed that database.rollback() must have been called (as it was alreay in the finally block); however, it must have failed for some reason, and this reason was not reported due to empty DatabaseException catch blocks.

c748abd4b It helps if I actually run tests, because then I find problems like stale references to the old name of the XSD.
ba54a9af0 Per nvoxland's feedback on https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2, I've renamed the XSD to go with the next minor release (2.1) instead of the next point release (2.0.2).
6f193f71b Include at least one test case for the namespaced-attributes-are-meaningless-to-liquibase feature. This test duplicates simpleChangeLogTest, except that (a) the schema used is the 2.0.2 schema and (b) it contains some meaningless attributes.
7b844ba36 Allow namespaced attributes on the following elements:  - <databaseChangeLog> - semantically, applying to this whole changelog.  - <include> - semantically, applying to the whole included changelog.  - <includeAll> - as with <include>  - <changeSet> - semantically, applying only to that change set.
